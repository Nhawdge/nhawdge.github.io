        <p> Hey there, Welcome to nhawdge.net. This is my personal site and playground. I've done a lot of thinking over
            the past couple years. I've grow a lot as a developer, and as a person. And most importantly. I have no idea
            where I'm going with this. </p>
        <p>I'm primarily creating this site as a reason to make a fun project I call, <a
                href="https://github.com/Nhawdge/gnaw.js">gnaw.js</a>. It's a funny story, I actually picked the name
            before I knew what it would do. Because I think it's hilarious to have Nhawdge's GnawJS. Cause they kinda
            sound alike? I guess. Ahh it's okay if you're not laughing. I'm my own target audience. Anyway, my project's
            goal is to help developers make github.io sites. If you're not familiar with them. They are github repos
            that are accessed like html files. I think a lot of the world is over engineered, because engineering is
            fun. But also getting your name on the internet is pretty important these days, especially for web
            developers. </p>
        <p> I will eventually add some sort of blog and other stuff back to this site. But we'll see how it goes. If
            you're looking to get in contact with me, there are some fancy links above. I hope you have a great day.
        </p>
