            Hey there, Welcome to nhawdge.net. This is my personal site and playground.
            I've done a lot of thinking over the past couple years. I've grow a lot as a developer, and as a person.
            And most importantly. I have no idea where I'm going with this.
        </p>
        <p>I'm primarily creating this site as a reason to make a fun project I call,
            <a href="https://github.com/Nhawdge/gnaw.js">gnaw.js</a>. It's a funny story, I actually picked the name
            before I knew what it would do. Because I think it's hilarious to have Nhawdge's GnawJS. Cause they kinda
            sound alike? I guess. Ahh it's okay if you're not laughing. I'm my own target audience. Anyway, my project's
            goal is to help developers
            make github.io sites. If you're not familiar with them. They are github repos that are accessed like html
            files. I think a lot of the world
            is over engineered, because engineering is fun. But also getting your name on the internet is pretty
            important these days,
            especially for web developers.
        </p>
        <p>
            I will eventually add some sort of blog and other stuff back to this site. But we'll see how it goes.
            If you're looking to get in contact with me, there are some fancy links above. I hope you have a great day.
        </p>

            My newest project is a party quiz game using websockets. At this point, it is in a very early stage, but you
            can play it on <a href="https://nhawdges-party-quiz.herokuapp.com">heroku</a>. Or if you'd like to read the
            code you can do so <a href="https://github.com/nhawdge/party-quiz">here on github</a>.
            <p>
                Lastly, I've been playing around with deno, and working on making <a
                    href="https://github.com/nhawdge/deno-blackjack"> blackjack</a> for no reason in particular. If
                you'd like to try it, you can actually run
                <code>
                    deno run https://github.com/Nhawdge/deno-blackjack/raw/master/BlackJack.ts
                </code>
                and the magic of deno will download and install it. It's not done at the time I'm writing this, but it
                will eventually be closer, I hope.
            </p>
