            My Name is John Pavek. I'm a web developer in Sioux Falls, South Dakota. I grew up in Fargo, North Dakota
            for the first 20 ish years of my life. I've been working professionally on the web since 2017. And for fun
            for a while before that. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/johnpavekisawesome.com">My first website</a>
            dates back to 2011. It was hosted on a machine with a 3GB hard drive, that I bought from a moving sale.
