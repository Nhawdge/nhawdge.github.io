            I assume you're here to play my terrible blackjack game. 
            <code>
                deno run https://github.com/Nhawdge/deno-blackjack/raw/master/BlackJack.ts
            </code>
            or else you might be here to talk about the technicals?
        </p>

            I learned about deno a couple months before it's 1.0 release, and I said to my coworker, We should have a
            deno release party.
            He immediately said no. Okay fine, so in a classic Bender-from-futurama move. I said, "Fine! I'll have my
            own release party... with blackjack!"

        <p> This was my first project using Deno, but <a href="https://github.com/Nhawdge/ts-talk-2019"> I've used
                typescript before</a>. I was really excited to learn this doesn't require setting up the TS compiler and
            just lets you start quickly.
            Early on I decided to try and 'over engineer' the project a bit and see what happens. I made a type for each
            of the different pieces of a card. The Suite, Face, and blackjack value. I actually used union types for all
            of these. I'll admit I was quite surprised with how useful this was. I had several errors caught before I
            even ran my project. The deck generator had a lot of bugs the first couple times through, thankfully it
            didn't have more.
